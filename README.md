## About

I decided to give my site a refresher starting from a barebones react configuration. My goal was to apply the same best practices I encounter in my day-to-day to a more modestly sized solution.

**Hot-reloading**, **code-splitting**, **modular classes**, **BEM**, **SASS**, but also **JSON API**, and all that was necessary to ensure compatibility with a wide range of web browsers and platforms.

I wanted to keep components atomic, well-defined and testable throughout, in order to remain able to test-drive the project and quickly plug functionality down the road. Essentially, to make a portfolio that down to its making showed the very same thing that it claimed. To both say *"this is **what** I do"* and *"this is **how** I do it"*.


## Status

**Stable. Ongoing.**

Under consideration:

- A lab section.
- Different technology for the back end.
- An iot interface. To showcase and centralize real time data.
- More webgl elements with some use of shaders.
- Some demonstrator of blockchain.
- Some application of ML. Machine learning using javascript.
- All rolled into one. 

*An iot interface that uses webgl and predictive analysis on a dataset securely maintainted over some blockchain ledger.* Or something to that effect.

## Installation

The project is tied to its back end platform, which uses Laravel. For the [front end](https://github.com/maurocolella/__new_me), `npm install` and `npm start`, or `yarn` and `yarn start`. For the [back end](https://github.com/maurocolella/__new_me.server), refer to the [Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation)

The project starts on `http://localhost:3000`

To lint the code, `npm eslint`.

To fix the code automatically, `npm fix`.

## Afterword

As much as possible, this project is intended to be a window into the current state of my growth as a web developer. Hence the intention to establish it as an open but stable canvas. Hence also the outlook: I refer you again to the **project status** and **features under consideration**.

For now, please feel free to head over to [https://mauro-colella.com/](https://mauro-colella.com/) - which should complement these explanations in a more interactive fashion.
